# Prediction-of-Solar-Energy-Production
Solar energy production is a crucial aspect of renewable energy utilization, as it relies on harnessing the sun's energy to generate electricity. However, various factors such as weather conditions (e.g., sunny days, rain, wind) can significantly impact the efficiency of solar panels, leading to fluctuations or insufficient energy production. This variability necessitates proactive measures to anticipate and meet energy demands, ensuring a consistent and reliable supply of electricity.
     To address this challenge, accurate forecasting of solar energy consumption becomes paramount. By predicting the amount of electricity that solar panels need to produce, it becomes possible to optimize energy generation and consumption, thereby enhancing overall efficiency. This is where deep learning tools, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units and Transformer architectures, come into play.
     Our project focuses on leveraging these advanced deep learning techniques to forecast solar energy consumption effectively. This involves developing predictive models capable of estimating the total active power required for each day over the next seven days. This task falls under the category of multi-step time series forecasting, given the need to predict energy consumption across multiple future time steps.
     LSTM units and Transformers offer distinct advantages in tackling such forecasting challenges. LSTM units excel at learning features from sequence data, supporting multivariate inputs, and generating variable-length output sequencesâ€”qualities essential for multi-step forecasting. Transformers, with their attention mechanisms and parallel processing capabilities, further enhance the model's ability to capture complex dependencies and patterns in the data.
In this project, we will first explore the application of LSTM units and Transformers individually for solar energy consumption prediction.
